     <h1>The story in the Book</h1>
     <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
     <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an
       hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>.<i>New Scientist</i>. and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of
        <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college,
        and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
     </p>
     <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room,
       sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wolde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of
         people who have nothing better to do.
       </q> Although many considered her pioneering work,unraveling the secrets fo the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think
       she had somthing better to do.
